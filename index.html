<h1>Jailbreak_987's Cydia Repo</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Jailbreak_987. I'm interested in coding and development especially for old iOS devices.</p>

<p>On this repo, you will find some of my iOS projects. To add it to cydia, add http://jelbrek897.github.io/cydia as a repo in the sources tab.</p>

<h3>SignalBars11</h3>

<p>SignalBars11 is a Winterboard theme for iOS devices running versions 7-9 which adds in the iOS 11+ signal bars. I have only tested it on iOS 7, so if you have issues on iOS 8 and 9 using the tweak, please message me on Reddit (my username is Jailbreak_987) and I will look into it.</p>

<p>Once you've installed SignalBars11 from my Cydia repo, go into Winterboard settings and enable the theme, then respring when prompted.</p>
