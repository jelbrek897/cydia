<h1>Jailbreak_987's Cydia Repo</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Jailbreak_987. I'm interested in coding and development especially for old iOS devices.</p>

<p>On this repo, you will find some of my iOS projects. To add it to cydia, add http://jelbrek897.github.io/cydia as a repo in the sources tab.</p>

<h2>IMPORTANT NOTE: This page isn't finished yet, I will add to it from time to time.</h2>

<p>PS: Don't actually try adding the repo right now since I haven't uploaded anything. If you try to add the repo, YOU WILL get an error of some sort.</p>
